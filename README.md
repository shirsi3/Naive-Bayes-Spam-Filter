his project comprises two Python scripts, each contributing to a pipeline for text classification and analysis, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## 1. projectphase1.py - Initial Data Processing and Model Training

- **Functionality:** 
  - Performs initial data processing, including text cleaning and feature extraction.
  - Uses Matplotlib for non-interactive plotting (Agg backend).
  - Applies a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.
  - Utilizes NLTK for natural language processing tasks.
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, nltk

## 2. group7-project.py - Extended Data Processing and Model Evaluation

- **Functionality:** 
  - Extends the data processing capabilities of the first script.
  - Includes additional visualization using seaborn.
  - Employs a Naive Bayes classifier with advanced feature extraction and model evaluation techniques.
  - Integrates regular expression operations for text processing.
- **Libraries Used:** sklearn, pandas, nltk, seaborn, scipy, matplotlib, re

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Processing and Feature Extraction:** 
   - `projectphase1.py` begins with cleaning text data, extracting features, and splitting the dataset for training and testing.

2. **Model Training and Initial Evaluation:** 
   - Implements a Naive Bayes classifier to perform text classification and assesses its performance.

3. **Advanced Processing and Evaluation:** 
   - `group7-project.py` builds upon the initial script, enhancing data processing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
